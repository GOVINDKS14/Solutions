/*
- Make a set to keep track of scanned letters of a particular substring.
- If the element scanned is present in the set this means that letter is already present in the substring. (We have to look for the duplicate letters.)
- Using this will not count the last substring as cnt will not get increased for the last substring.
- So, we have to return ++cnt.
